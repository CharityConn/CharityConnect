### **Eligibility:**

To be eligible for the Cool Cat Raffle, participants must hold an adopted Smart Cat xNFT.

The participant's Smart Cat level determines the number of entries into the weekly raffle.

### **Raffle Details:**

The raffle will run for five weeks, starting from December 8, 2023.

One Cool Cat will be raffled off each week on the following dates (AEST):
- 8 Dec
- 15 Dec
- 22 Dec
- 29 Dec
- 5 Jan

Winners will be selected by Smart Layer Discord community members via random generator, from all eligible entries.

The community members who pick the winners will be chosen by merit, contributions, or activities.

The picking will happen on a Smart Layer Discord live stream, and be completed by picking random numbers via random.org. The numbers will then be passed to the development team to process and retrieve from the smart contract of the Smart Cat.

The development team and community members of the Smart Layer project maintain a formal separation and are not affiliated or associated in any capacity. This distinction ensures transparency and impartiality throughout the selection process. The random selection of winners is conducted independently by a designated group of community members, with no direct involvement from the development team. This approach safeguards the integrity and fairness of the contest.

### **Entries and Smart Cat Levels:**

Participants earn additional entries based on their Smart Cat's level.

Entry breakdown: Level 1: +1 entry, Level 2: +2 entries, Level 3: +3 entries, and so on up to Level 20: +20 entries.

For example, a Smart Cat at Level 3 will have a total of 6 entries into the raffle.

### **Claiming Prizes:**

Winners will be announced on Discord and the Cool Cat NFT will be sent to the winner's wallet address.

Winners will be notified through a combination of on-chain messaging within the Cat messaging system and official announcements across all Smart Token Labs communication channels.

In the event that any prizes remain unclaimed following a four-week period, a redrawing process will be initiated. This redrawing process will adhere to the same rules and procedures as the original draw, utilizing a snapshot of the entries as of the original draw date.

### **Disqualification:**

Participants found in violation of the Smart Cats community guidelines or engaging in fraudulent activities will be disqualified.

### **Changes to Campaign:**

The Smart Cats team reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the promotion at any time without prior notice.

### **Legal Compliance:**

Participants must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of their respective local jurisdiction.
